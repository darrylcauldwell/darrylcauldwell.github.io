Five years ago I moved my [personal blog to GitHub Pages](/post/jekyll). Up to now, my workflow has been to clone to local repository make changes directly to master branch, build static website files, test locally and then push all changes upstream for GitHub pages to build. This simple workflow has worked perfectly however recently I find myself working across multiple devices and on multiple posts simultaneously. 

As such I have moved to use GitHub branching in my workflow to assist meet the demands of my evolved working situation.

## Create new branch for post

First think to do is clone the existing repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darrylcauldwell/darrylcauldwell.github.io.git
cd darrylcauldwell.github.io
```

If I check there is single branch named 'master'.

```bash
git branch

* master
```

First step is to create new branch to work in and switch to it.

```bash
git checkout -b blog-branch

git branch

master
* blog-branch
```

Add files,  make changes within branch etc, .

```bash
On branch blog-branch
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/blog-branch'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        content/post/git-branch.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Once we're happy with changes to the branch approve the changes and add the files to the index.

```bash
git add content/post/git-branch.md

git status                        
On branch blog-branch
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/blog-branch'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   content/post/git-branch.md
``` 

Then commit the changes to the local repository.

```bash
git commit -m 'these are changes I made'

[blog-branch 8b566a8] these are changes I made
 1 file changed, 51 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

Once happy push the branch to remote upstream repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin blog-branch
```

## Make changes to existing branch

The workflow is slightly different if I have created a branch and want to return to work on it.  To simulate this if I delete the folder with local repository and create new clone from GitHub again.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darrylcauldwell/darrylcauldwell.github.io.git

Cloning into 'darrylcauldwell.github.io'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 7361, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5996/5996), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1761/1761), done.
remote: Total 7361 (delta 2975), reused 5678 (delta 2660), pack-reused 1365
Receiving objects: 100% (7361/7361), 66.43 MiB | 5.85 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (3667/3667), done.
```

When creating new clone only the 'master' branch, we can see the branch on remote/origin.

```bash
git branch -a

* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/blog-branch
  remotes/origin/master
```

When look to switch local respository to branch with identical name the client is intelligent enough to link the local and remote and mark to track.

```bash
git checkout blog-branch

Branch 'blog-branch' set up to track remote branch 'blog-branch' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'blog-branch'

git branch -a           

* blog-branch
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/blog-branch
  remotes/origin/master
```

From here we can continue making changes, commit the files to local repository and then try and push them to remote as before.

## In-branch blog testing

So far I have been updating blog content in markdown files. The Hugo engine takes these markdown files and creates all of the pages required for static website. Prior to posting it is good to test the post formatting looks good, the image links work etc. From within the branch we can run Hugo and use browser to test.

```bash
hugo server

Start building sites â€¦
