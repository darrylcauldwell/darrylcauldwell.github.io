When I worked as an architect working with AWS I used event-driven automation with AWS Lambda to integrate distributed systems. This event-driven automation allowed me to put complex systems in place very simply. The VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) aims to facilitate event-driven automation based on vCenter Server events.

## VMware Event Broker Appliance

VMware provides the VMware Event Broker Appliance as a [fling](https://flings.vmware.com/vmware-event-broker-appliance). The [system architecture](https://vmweventbroker.io/kb/architecture) shows that the appliance is built on a Photon OS running Kubernetes with Contour acting as ingress controller. The event broker appliance is composed of two components an event router and a choice of event stream processor Knative, OpenFaaS or AWS EventBridge.

## Knative Eventing

Since getting engaged with the Kubernetes community it seemed the biggest barrier to entry for most people was complexity.  Knative looks to obfuscate some of that complexity and provide an abstraction that allows more focus on business functionality. It offers two core functions:

* Serving - Run serverless containers on Kubernetes
* Eventing - Universal subscription, delivery, and management of events

Knative Eventing is composed of Knative Broker and Trigger objects which make it easy to filter events based on event attributes. A Broker provides a bucket of events which can be selected by attribute. It receives events and forwards them to subscribers defined by one or more matching Triggers.

![Broker Trigger Architecture](/images/veba-knative-broker-trigger-overview.svg)

The v0.6 default install generates configuration for binding to vCenter Server with embedded Knative eventing 'config/event-router-config.yml':

```yaml
##Â SSH to appliance
cat config/event-router-config.yml

apiVersion: event-router.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: RouterConfig
metadata:
  name: router-config-knative
eventProcessor:

  type: knative
  knative:
    insecureSSL: false
    encoding: binary
    destination:
      ref:
        apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
        kind: Broker

        apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
        kind: Broker
        name: default
        namespace: vmware-functions
```

## Consuming Example Knative Function

The GitHub repository contains a folder containing [example Knative functions](https://github.com/vmware-samples/vcenter-event-broker-appliance/tree/development/examples/knative).

If we look at the example function which triggers each of each all events to Pod console. To achieve this it defines a Knative eventing resource which has an unfiltered trigger on the default broker and defines Service named 'kn-ps-echo' as subscriber.

```yaml
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: veba-ps-echo-trigger
  labels:
    app: veba-ui
spec:
  broker: default
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: kn-ps-echo
```

To perform action the example defines a Knative servicing Service resource which calls container image. We can see the service definition pulls a container from the VMware public container registry named 'kn-ps-echo' version 1.0.

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kn-ps-echo
  labels:
    app: veba-ui
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "1"
        autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "1"
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: projects.registry.vmware.com/veba/kn-ps-echo:1.0
```

Within the example folder is the Dockerfile used to create the container. We can see this defines a Powershell runtime environment with the [CloudEvents SDK](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/CloudEvents.Sdk) and [ThreadJob](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ThreadJob) modules installed. When running the container executes server.ps1 which starts a CloudEvent HTTP listener and if we look within that it calls handler.ps1 which in this case is what outputs event contents.  Both of these Powershell scripts are copied into the container at point of creation.

```dockerfile
FROM photon:3.0
ENV TERM linux
ENV PORT 8080

# Set terminal. If we don't do this, weird readline things happen.
RUN echo "/usr/bin/pwsh" >> /etc/shells && \
    echo "/bin/pwsh" >> /etc/shells && \
    tdnf install -y powershell-7.0.3-2.ph3 unzip && \
    pwsh -c "Set-PSRepository -Name PSGallery -InstallationPolicy Trusted" && \
    find / -name "net45" | xargs rm -rf && \
    tdnf erase -y unzip && \
    tdnf clean all
RUN pwsh  -Command 'Install-Module ThreadJob -Force -Confirm:$false'
RUN pwsh -Command 'Install-Module -Name CloudEvents.Sdk'

COPY server.ps1 ./
COPY handler.ps1 handler.ps1

CMD ["pwsh","./server.ps1"]
```

To test the example we can first pull and execute the manifest file.

```bash
curl -O https://github.com/vmware-samples/vcenter-event-broker-appliance/blob/development/examples/knative/powershell/kn-ps-echo/function.yaml
kubectl apply --filename function.yaml --namespace vmware-functions

service.serving.knative.dev/kn-ps-echo created
trigger.eventing.knative.dev/kn-ps-echo-trigger created
```

We see the service and eventing resources are created and we can check the vmware-functions namespace to get the kn-ps-echo function pod names. There are two containers in the pod, the user-container runs the function so we can follow its logs and see the flow of vCenter events being echo'd.

```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace vmware-functions

So we can see all events are of the same Type: but the Subject: is populated with descriptive name. The subject contents maps to the vCenter Server event description a list of descriptions by vCenter Server version can be found [here](https://github.com/lamw/vcenter-event-mapping).

Note: At the time of running the example didn't seem to be working correctly as it did not output the CloudEvent Data.

## Creating A Knative Function

So we can see it is easy to consume a pre-built function but I wonder how hard it is to create one to meet a bespoke need.  Pleased to report that it turns out that is also pretty easy.

If we start off by defining problem,  maybe maintaining the synchronicity of state between two systems. When performing ESXi host lifecycle operations it is useful to mark this state in multiple systems. Setting object state to maintenance mode in vCenter Server can trigger vMotion work away from host and prevent scheduling of new workload on host. Setting object state to maintenance mode in vRealize Operations helps reduce amount of false positive issues relating to lifecycle operations. Host lifecycle operations like patching are typically initiated via vCenter Server so its likely maintenance mode will be set enabled and disabled correctly. It might be easy to miss mirroring this operation in vRealize Operations.

So the first thing we need to do is identify the vCenter Server event created when a host is placed in maintenance mode. Checking the event documentaion we can find the two events are [EnteredMaintenanceModeEvent](https://vdc-repo.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/fe08899f-1eec-4d8d-b3bc-a6664c168c2c/7fdf97a1-4c0d-4be0-9d43-2ceebbc174d9/doc/vim.event.EnteredMaintenanceModeEvent.html) and [ExitMaintenanceModeEvent](https://vdc-repo.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/fe08899f-1eec-4d8d-b3bc-a6664c168c2c/7fdf97a1-4c0d-4be0-9d43-2ceebbc174d9/doc/vim.event.ExitMaintenanceModeEvent.html). The [vRealize Operations Manager Suite API](https://code.vmware.com/apis/364/vrealize-operations) shows the two API calls which control Maintenance Mode.

```
## Enter vROps Maintenance Mode
PUT /api/resources/{id}/maintained

## Exit vROps Maintenance Mode
DELETE /suite-api/api/resources/{id}/maintained
```

I'll start by creating a container image for the enter event. We can reuse the example Dockerfile and server.ps1 without change.

```bash
##Â Create folders and pull down reusable example files
mkdir veba-knative-mm-enter
cd veba-knative-mm-enter
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware-samples/vcenter-event-broker-appliance/master/examples/knative/powershell/kn-ps-echo/Dockerfile
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware-samples/vcenter-event-broker-appliance/master/examples/knative/powershell/kn-ps-echo/server.ps1
```

We can then create some Powershell which takes input from event and calls REST API of vROps.

```powershell
Function Process-Handler {
   param(
      [Parameter(Position=0,Mandatory=$true)][CloudNative.CloudEvents.CloudEvent]$CloudEvent
   )

# Form cloudEventData object and output to console for debugging
$cloudEventData = $cloudEvent | Read-CloudEventJsonData -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Depth 10
if($cloudEventData -eq $null) {
   $cloudEventData = $cloudEvent | Read-CloudEventData
   }
Write-Host "Full contents of CloudEventData`n $(${cloudEventData} | ConvertTo-Json)`n"

# Perform onward action

## vROps REST API documentation https://code.vmware.com/apis/364/vrealize-operations

## Check secret in place which supplies vROps environment variables
Write-Host "vropsFqdn:" ${env:vropsFqdn}
Write-Host "vropsUser:" ${env:vropsUser}
Write-Host "vropsPassword:" ${env:vropsPassword}

## Form unauthorized headers payload
$headers = @{
   "Content-Type" = "application/json";
   "Accept"  = "application/json"
   }

## Acquire bearer token
$uri = "https://" + $env:vropsFqdn + "/suite-api/api/auth/token/acquire"
$basicAuthBody = @{
    username = $env:vropsUser;
    password = $env:vropsPassword;
    }
$basicAuthBodyJson = $basicAuthBody | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
Write-Host "Acquiring bearer token ..."
$bearer = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $basicAuthBodyJson -SkipCertificateCheck | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Bearer token is" $bearer.token

## Form authorized headers payload
$authedHeaders = @{
   "Content-Type" = "application/json";
   "Accept"  = "application/json";
   "Authorization" = "vRealizeOpsToken " + $bearer.token
   }

## Get host ResourceID
$uri = "https://" + $env:vropsFqdn + "/suite-api/api/adapterkinds/VMWARE/resourcekinds/HostSystem/resources?name=" + $esxiHost
Write-Host "Acquiring host ResourceID ..."
$resource = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -Headers $authedHeaders -SkipCertificateCheck
$resourceJson = $resource.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "ResourceID of host is " $resourceJson.resourceList[0].identifier

## Mark host as maintenance mode
$uri = "https://" + $env:vropsFqdn + "/suite-api/api/resources/" + $resourceJson.resourceList[0].identifier + "/maintained"
Write-Host "Marking host as vROps maintenance mode ..."
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method PUT -Headers $authedHeaders -SkipCertificateCheck

## Get host maintenance mode state
$uri = "https://" + $env:vropsFqdn + "/suite-api/api/adapterkinds/VMWARE/resourcekinds/HostSystem/resources?name=" + $esxiHost
Write-Host "Acquiring host maintenance mode state ..."
$resource = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -Headers $authedHeaders -SkipCertificateCheck
$resourceJson = $resource.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Host maintenence mode state is " $resourceJson.resourceList[0].resourceStatusStates[0].resourceState
Write-Host "Note: STARTED=Not In Maintenance | MAINTAINED_MANUAL=In Maintenance"
}
```

In order to be environmentally agnositic I have the script use Environment Variables. We can store these in a Kubernetes Secret resource which can be associated with the containers and available at script runtime.

```
kubectl -n vmware-functions create secret generic veba-knative-mm-vrops \
  --from-literal=vropsFqdn=vrops.cork.local \
  --from-literal=vropsUser=admin \
  --from-literal=vropsPassword='VMware1!'
```

With the Dockerfile and scripts in place we can look to build the container image locally and then push this to a public container registry.

```bash
# Build local image with tag for GitHub Container Registry
docker build --tag ghcr.io/darrylcauldwell/veba-ps-enter-mm:1.0 .

# Generate GitHub Personal Access Token
# Connect to GitHub Container Registry
#Â Use Personal Access Token when prompted for password
docker login ghcr.io -u darrylcauldwell

# Push local image to GitHub Container Registry
docker push ghcr.io/darrylcauldwell/veba-ps-enter-mm:1.0
```

Once the container is available in public repository I can look to create a Knative service and trigger resource which links to container image and has association with the secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: veba-ps-enter-mm-service
  labels:
    app: veba-ui
  namespace: vmware-functions
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        autoscaling.knative.dev/maxScale: "1"
        autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "1"
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: ghcr.io/darrylcauldwell/veba-ps-enter-mm:1.0
          envFrom:
            - secretRef:
                name: veba-knative-mm-vrops
---
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: veba-ps-enter-mm-trigger
  labels:
    app: veba-ui
  namespace: vmware-functions
spec:
  broker: default
  filter:
    attributes:
        type: com.vmware.event.router/event
        subject: EnteredMaintenanceModeEvent
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: veba-ps-enter-mm-service
```

The exit function is logically laid out the same but with different trigger filter and handler action. With the manifest files created both can now be applied.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darrylcauldwell/veba-knative-mm-enter/main/veba-knative-mm-enter.yml

service.serving.knative.dev/veba-ps-enter-mm-service created
trigger.eventing.knative.dev/veba-ps-enter-mm-trigger created

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darrylcauldwell/veba-knative-mm-exit/master/veba-knative-mm-exit.yml

service.serving.knative.dev/veba-ps-exit-mm-service created
trigger.eventing.knative.dev/veba-ps-exit-mm-trigger created
```

Once the container image has pulled down from repository can check the created resources.

```bash
kubectl -n vmware-functions get kservice

```

With the functions in place we can follow the logs on the container and place a host into maintenance mode to check it works.

```bash
kubectl -n vmware-functions logs veba-ps-enter-mm-service-00001-deployment-d689d7fbd-9gtlv user-container --follow
