When writing a VMware design just writing can be dry and simple messages get hard to convey that is why its always 
nice to add diagrams.  Unfortunately VMware don't seem to prepare any Visio stencils,  but luckily Maish Saidel-Keesing 
has created some from the official VMware Powerpoint library icons and diagrams.
