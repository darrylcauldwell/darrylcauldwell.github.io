I changed jobs in July 2019 to join VMware a silicon valley based company which provides cloud computing and virtualization software and services. I accepted the job for the many interesting technology challenges I would be able to work towards solving. The technical aspects of the job do indeed make work fulfilling. An unexpected bonus has been the focus VMware puts on fostering values and a workplace that encourages and supports growth, learning and collaboration.

There are many positive aspects I have taken from the corporate initiatives around the [epic2](https://blogs.vmware.com/cfo/epic2-vmware-values/) values. One of the important skills I am begining to learn is [self-reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-reflection), another is [goal-setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting).

I have under taken my personal challenges over the years and the occasion of a new decade seemed a good reason to undertake another. With a young family and demanding job I need to make sure that the goals will stretch me but is achieveble.

## Plant-Based Diet

"In the UK, it is estimated that well-planned completely plant-based, or vegan, diets need just one third of the fertile land, fresh water and energy of the typical British ‘meat-and-dairy’ based diet. With meat and dairy being the leading contributor to greenhouse (GHG) emissions, reducing animal based foods and choosing a wide range of plant foods can be beneficial to the planet and our health." [Source DBA](https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/plant-based_diet)

Types of plant-based diets include:

* Lacto-ovo vegetarians ( plant based but includes dairy foods and eggs )
* Ovo vegetarians ( plant based but includes eggs )
* Vegans ( plant based only )

My original goal was to take part in [veganuary](https://uk.veganuary.com/). As well as this focussed month I also am also working towards another goal around fitness with my local gym [Fitism](http://www.fitism.co.uk/). The specified nutrition plan involves a daily diet around 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein and 30% fat. Moving to a plant-based diet will add complexity to what I am already finding is a complex balancing act. I presently struggle getting sufficient protein, having option to use eggs and potentially whey based supplement will hopefully allow me to progress both goals in parrallel.

**Measurable Goal** - Lacto-ovo vegetarian between 1st and 31st January

## 12,000 Steps Daily Average

I an lucky enough to live in a natually beautiful location. It is easy during the winter months when it is dark both before and after work to reduce what we do. Jogging and running when it is slippery can easily lead to minor injury. By leaving the car and walking I think it should be possible for me to average walking 6 miles / [12,000 steps](https://www.verywellfit.com/how-many-walking-steps-are-in-a-mile-3435916) per day.

**Measurable Goal** - Average 12,000 steps per day between 1st and 31st January

## Detoxification

I have tried some very focussed detox programs over the years. I do not intend to follow a particular defined program during January. I do intend to take opportunity to do something in this area. Detoxification is about resting, cleansing and nourishing the body from the inside out. Processing alcohol and cafine puts a strain on the organs. It is easy to increase drinking alcohol and cafine over time and useful every now and then to abstain. Whichever detox program I have followed they all have all included 'lemon water' for helpsing your digestion, flushes out toxins and cleanses the liver. 

**Measurable Goal** - Zero alcohol per day between 1st and 31st January

**Measurable Goal** - No more than one cup of coffee per day between 1st and 31st January

**Measurable Goal** - Glass of lemon water per day between 1st and 31st January

## Yoga

I tried yoga first while working in India some fifteen years ago. Being on the tall side I've always been conscious of my back health and found yoga helped. I used to regularly attend yoga sessions in evenings. When I joined VMware I was a remote member of a team based in the US and team meetings clashed.  More recently our team has restructured and team now is EMEA based. Since the re-organization I had not got around to re-joining the yoga sessions. 

**Measurable Goal** - Attend at least three of the four weekly yoga sessions
